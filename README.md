# sassy-test

Sassy Test is a simple helper utility for creating unit tests of Sass modules. Works great with mocha or jasmine.

Install for your Sass module with: `npm install --save-dev sassy-test`

## Development

Forking, hacking, and tearing apart of this software is welcome! It's still very simple and could use additional features and conveniences.

After you've cloned this repository, run `npm install` and then you'll be able to run the module's mocha and eslint tests with `npm test`.
